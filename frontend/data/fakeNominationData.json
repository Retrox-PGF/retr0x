BLS12-381 can also be used to enable new wallet types and using retroactive public goods funding to support maintenance of the library and feature development will benefit the entire Eth ecosystem.",

This is an extremely important test suite for possible future client implementors to check behaviour/spec conformance and is an important component of the ethereum CI pipeline, results can be viewed here: https://hivetests.ethdevops.io/. Hive will likely also be repurposed to support eth2 in the future.",
